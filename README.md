# Harris-Hawks-Feature-Selection-in-Distributed-Machine-Learning-for-Secure-IoT-Environments
Abstract:
The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has dramatically expanded in our daily lives, playing a pivotal role in the enablement of smart cities, healthcare, and buildings. Emerging technologies, such as IoT, seek to improve the quality of service in different sectors. Although IoT applications are helpful, they present a real risk as the large number of interconnected devices using heterogeneous networks increases the number of potential IoT attacks. IoT applications can collect and transfer sensitive data. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new methods to detect hacked IoT devices. This paper proposes a Feature Selection (FS) model based on Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) and Random Weight Network (RWN) to detect IoT botnet attacks launched from compromised IoT devices. 
Distributed Machine Learning (ML) aims to train models locally on edge devices without sharing data to a central server. Therefore, we apply the proposed approach using centralized and distributed ML models. Both learning models are evaluated under two benchmark datasets for IoT botnet attacks and compared with other well-known classification techniques using different evaluation indicators. 
The experimental results of the proposed method show an improvement in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure in most cases. The proposed method achieves an average F-measure up to 99.9\%. More so, the results show that the distributed ML model achieves competitive performance against centralized ML while maintaining data locally.
